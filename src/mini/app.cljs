;; Repro for strange issue with reitit + replicant
;; I am probably holding one or both of these wrong
;;
;; Repro:
;; 1. Start the repl (jack in, shadow-cljs, start and connect the :app build)
;; 2. Open http://localhost:8787 in the browser (Chrome)
;; 3. Confirm that "Select..." is selected (inspect in dev tools too)
;; 4. Select "11" (say)
;; 5. Confirm that "11" is selected (also check the browser url)
;; 6. Go back in the browser
;; 7. Confirm that "Select..." is selected
;; 8. Go forward in the browser
;; Expected: "11" is selected
;;           in the elements inspector "11" is selected
;;           the browser url is "http://localhost:8787/#/select/11"
;; Actual: "Select..." is selected
;;         in the elements inspector "11" is selected
;;         the browser url is "http://localhost:8787/#/select/11"
;;
;; Things check out in Safari
;;
;; Another Chrome specific strangeness:
;; 1. With the repl started
;; 2. Open http://localhost:8787 in a new tab
;; 3. Confirm that "Select..." is selected
;; 4. Evaluate the dispatches in the below Rich comment form
;; 5. With each dispatch confirm that the browser do the right things
;;    (UI, url, elements inspector)
;; 6. Confirm that now "7" is selected
;; 7. Go back in the browser
;; Expected: "11" is selected
;; Actual: The browser loads its new tab page
;; 8. Go forward in the browser
;; 9. Confirm that now "7" is selected
;; 10. Go back in the browser
;; Expected: "11" is selected
;; Actual: The browser loads its new tab page
;; 11. Go forward in the browser
;; 12. Confirm that now "7" is selected
;; 13. Reload the page
;; 14. Confirm that now "7" is selected
;; 15. Go back in the browser
;; Expected: (I don't know what you now expect ðŸ˜‚)
;; Actual: "11" is selected
;;         and navigation back and forth in the history works fine ðŸ¤¯
;;
;; In Safari the browser behaves as expected
